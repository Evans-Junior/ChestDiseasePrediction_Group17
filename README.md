## Introduction

The Tuberculosis and Pneumonia Prediction App allows users to upload X-ray images for prediction. The application uses two deep learning modelsâ€”one for Tuberculosis prediction and the other for Pneumonia prediction.

## Features

- Upload X-ray images for Tuberculosis or Pneumonia prediction.
- Instantly get predictions based on pre-trained deep learning models.

## Installation
    1. Ensure you have Python installed.

    2. Clone the repository:
        bash
        Copy code
